             <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Building Craving was fun. This helped my perspective of design to be more User-centric. I built this with users in mind from start to finish.I invested a lot of time and energy conducting user research and user testing. 
Even with that being said, I do believe that an area for development and improvement would be in usability testing. I would've engaged in more testing with potential users to narrow down on the user flows and the functionality of the app compared to other food applications on the market.</p>
