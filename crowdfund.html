       <h3>Case Study - Lend A Hand</h3>
           <h5>Summary</h5>
           <p>Crowd Funding is an effective way to raise money for ventures.This has been an existing project that was taking place through mail-order subscriptions and other methods. But with Internet-mediated registries, crowd funding model has becoming a challenge with various factors including trustworthy, easy to use websites, tracking statistics, etc… 
           Next to being trustworthy, user experiences have been setting a back for the people who desire to donate. I have designed ‘Lend A Hand’, a CrowdFunding application addressing all the pain areas with improved User experience.</p>

        <h5>The Problem</h5>
        
        <p>Crowd Funding applications allows people to donate, while User experiences is a glitch.
I conducted a user survey which opened up various avenues that helped me build the application. While all the users showed interest in donating for various causes, they were equally interested in keeping track of donations and statistics like total collected amount, total needed, etc for the event/cause. On the other hand, young users complained about the time an application consumes to complete the process. It is frustrating for them as they donate smaller amounts on a regular basis.</p>
